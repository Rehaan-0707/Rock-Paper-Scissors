# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Description

A decentralized multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game built on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts. This implementation features a commit-reveal scheme to ensure fair gameplay by preventing players from seeing their opponent's move before making their own decision. The smart contract manages game state, validates moves, and automatically determines winners without requiring a trusted third party.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, trustless, and engaging gaming experience on the blockchain where players can enjoy classic games with guaranteed fairness. By leveraging blockchain technology and cryptographic commit-reveal schemes, we eliminate the possibility of cheating while maintaining the fun and competitive spirit of traditional Rock Paper Scissors.

The project aims to demonstrate how simple games can be enhanced through blockchain technology, providing a foundation for more complex decentralized gaming applications and fostering adoption of Web3 gaming experiences.
